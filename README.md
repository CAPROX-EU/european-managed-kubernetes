# european-managed-kubernetes
inspired by Adrian Todorov [blogpost](https://atodorov.me/2020/06/14/comparing-kubernetes-managed-services-across-digital-ocean-scaleway-ovhcloud-and-linode/) from 2020.

This GitHub project goal is to give an overview of european kubernetes hosters and there technical details, issues, pricing and characteristics. 
This should empower **you** to decide where you want to host your application and which hoster fits the best for you.
